		<p>A 3D First Person horror prototype where you navigate a fast food playground while evading a monster. Developed as part of an internal 2020 game jam at Akupara Games, I pitched the concept and was team lead/designer. The game was built over the course of two weeks with a team, with some additional time spent preparing for release on <a href="https://akuparajams.itch.io/playmaze-panic" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/playmazepanic/573906" target="_blank">GameJolt</a>. </p>
		
		<p>Further info about the development of the game can be found in the <a href="https://www.akuparagames.com/2021/01/21/the-akupara-game-jam-playmaze-panic/" target="_blank">blog post</a> or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m4IDcZhjvo" target="_blank">podcast</a>.</p>

		<p>A 2-player fighting game where players slap each other with cartoon characters. Players control the game by wearing physical costumes with accelerometers tracking movements, allowing actual slap fights with the costumes. I built the game in Unity, and used Arduino for controller software and hardware. Concept, art, and costume creation was by <a href="http://terencetolman.com/" target="_blank">Terence Tolman</a>.</p> 
		<p>Slap Friends was featured at <b>Alt.Ctrl.GDC 2016, GDC Experimental Gameplay Workshop 2016, and Indiecade 2017.</b></p>
